# Introduction

Simple website project :)

Most of the tools we are using should be installed on the repo, so there is no need to have to install anything before running the webpage.

### Structure

- **Node.js**: As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.
- **jQuery**: A lightweight, "write less, do more", Javascript library.
The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

# Setup

- Run `npm i` in terminal to install all modules/packages.
- Run `node server.js` in terminal to load webpage
- Go to `localhost:3000` to see webpage
