        <h1>What is Mental Health?</h1>
        <section>
            <p>Mental health is about how we feel, think, and connect with the world around us. It influences how we
                cope with stress, relate to others, and make everyday decisions. It is not only about avoiding illness —
                it is about feeling balanced, supported, and able to manage when life becomes challenging.</p>

            <h3>What Mental Health Covers:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emotional wellbeing:</strong> Being able to recognise and express your emotions — sadness,
                    joy, anger — and manage them in healthy ways.</li>
                <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Recovering after difficult times and finding strength even when life
                    feels heavy.</li>
                <li><strong>Social connection:</strong> Having people in your life who understand you, support you, and
                    help you feel less alone.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear thinking:</strong> Making decisions that feel right for you and staying grounded when
                    your thoughts are racing.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

                <h3>Why Mental Health Matters:</h3>
                <p>Mental health is not just important — it is essential.</p>
                <h3>It affects:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every stage of life, from childhood through to later years.</li>
                    <li>Your physical health — including your sleep, energy levels, and immune system.</li>
                    <li>Your relationships, your work, and how you feel on a daily basis.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Some Common Mental Health Difficulties:</h3>
            <p>You may have heard of these — or experienced some yourself:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Depression</li>
                <li>Anxiety</li>
                <li>Bipolar Disorder</li>

        <section>
            <h3>Looking After Your Mental Health:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Get enough rest, eat well, and stay active</li>
                <li>Keep in touch with people who make you feel positive</li>
                <li>Find ways to manage stress — even small actions can help</li>
                <li>Seek help when you need it — through talking therapies, medication, or simply a conversation with
                    someone who listens</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <div class="callout">
            <strong>If You are Struggling at the Moment:</strong> Please do not ignore it. You matter. You are not
            alone, and support is available.

            <h3>Here are some steps you could take:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Speak to someone you trust — a friend, a family member, or anyone who will listen without judgement
                </li>
                <li>Look after yourself — even the smallest steps count</li>
                <li>Contact a mental health professional — they are there to help, not criticise</li>
                <li>
                    Fill in the support form — it is a safe way to begin:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <button onclick="moveToForm()" class="btn">Go to Support Form</a>
                </li>
                <li>Call a helpline if you are in crisis — you do not have to face this on your own</li>
            </ol>
