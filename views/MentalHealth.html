        <h1>What is Mental Health?</h1>
        <section>
            <p>Mental health is all about how we feel, think, and connect with the world around us. It shapes how we handle
                stress, relate to people, and make everyday choices. It’s not just about avoiding illness — it’s about feeling
                balanced, supported, and able to cope when life gets tough.</p>

            <h3>What Mental Health Covers:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emotional wellbeing:</strong> Being able to feel your feelings — sadness, joy, anger — and
                    manage them in healthy ways.</li>
                <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Bouncing back after hard times and finding strength even when things
                    feel heavy.</li>
                <li><strong>Social connection:</strong> Having people around you who get you, support you, and help you
                    feel less alone.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear thinking:</strong> Making decisions that feel right and staying grounded when your
                    mind feels busy.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
