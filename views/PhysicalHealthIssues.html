        <h1>What is Physical Health?</h1>
        <section>
            <p>Your body and mind are closely linked. When you take care of your physical health, you are also giving your
                mental health a boost. Movement, rest, and good nutrition are not simply chores — they are ways to feel
                better, think more clearly, and look after yourself.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Why It Matters:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Staying active:</strong> Whether it is walking, dancing, swimming, or stretching — movement
                    benefits your mood, energy levels, and sleep.</li>
                <li><strong>Eating well:</strong> Nourishing your body with balanced meals fuels your brain and helps you
                    feel more stable.</li>
                <li><strong>Getting enough sleep:</strong> Rest is essential for recovery. It supports focus, emotional
                    regulation, and feeling refreshed.</li>
                <li><strong>Listening to your body:</strong> Pain, fatigue, or tension are signs — not inconveniences. Pay
                    attention to them and respond with care.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

                    <li>Your energy and concentration — helping you perform well in studies, work, and daily life.</li>
                    <li>Your mood — both movement and rest play a vital role in mental health.</li>

                    <li>Your daily routine — from sleep and eating habits to overall self-care.</li>
                </ul>
